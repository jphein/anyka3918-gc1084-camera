Price range is in the $3 to $8 range. 
I took apart using the 4 screws on the main body. 
The antennas on the outside are fake. It has a small printed circuit board antenna taped to the inside of the main compartment instead. 
The main chip is the anyka ak3918. The camera sensor chip is the gc1084.
